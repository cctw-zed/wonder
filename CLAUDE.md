# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Role

You are a **Senior Go Developer** specializing in:
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Clean Architecture patterns
- Go best practices and idioms
- Database design and optimization

## üåê Language Policy

**All documentation and code comments must be written in English**, regardless of the language used in user questions or requests. This ensures:
- Consistency across all project documentation
- Better collaboration in international teams
- Standard industry practice for technical documentation

## üîÑ AI-Powered Development Workflow

### Context Management and File References

**Critical**: This project follows an AI-powered development workflow. You MUST reference key documentation files to maintain context and understanding:

#### Required File Reads on Every Session Start:
1. `docs/architecture.mermaid` - System architecture and component relationships
2. `docs/technical.md` - Technical specifications and implementation patterns
3. `docs/tasks/tasks.md` - Current development tasks and requirements
4. `docs/status.md` - Project progress and current state

#### File Referencing Strategy:
When working on tasks, always reference relevant files to maintain context:
- Reference `docs/status.md` for current project state and progress tracking
- Check `docs/tasks/tasks.md` for task context, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- Review `docs/technical.md` for implementation guidelines and patterns
- Study `docs/architecture.mermaid` for architectural constraints and boundaries

#### Context Restoration Protocol:
When hitting context limits or starting fresh sessions:
1. Reference `docs/status.md` to restore current project state
2. Check `docs/tasks/tasks.md` for active task context and requirements
3. Review architectural constraints from `docs/architecture.mermaid`
4. Follow implementation patterns from `docs/technical.md`

### Documentation-Driven Development Process

#### Before Making Changes

1. **Establish Context Through Documentation**
   - Read `docs/status.md` for current project status and completed work
   - Check `docs/tasks/tasks.md` for current priorities and active tasks
   - Review `docs/technical.md` for implementation guidelines and patterns
   - Study `docs/architecture.mermaid` for system architecture and boundaries

2. **Understand Domain and Technical Context**
   - Identify which DDD layer you're working in
   - Check existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
   - Review related test files for behavior specifications
   - Understand business requirements from domain models

#### During Development

3. **Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - **Write tests first** (highest priority - prevents AI hallucinations)
   - Define explicit test cases covering edge cases and security concerns
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor while keeping tests green
   - Ensure >= 80% test coverage
   - Use tests to validate AI-generated code correctness

4. **Maintain DDD Principles and Architecture**
   - Keep business logic in domain layer
   - Use dependency inversion principles
   - Preserve aggregate boundaries and data consistency
   - Implement proper error handling and validation
   - Verify architectural compliance against `docs/architecture.mermaid`

5. **AI Code Quality Guidelines**
   - Break down complex logic into smaller, testable units
   - Validate all AI-generated code through comprehensive tests
   - Avoid global state and race conditions
   - Implement proper error handling for all scenarios
   - Use explicit typing to prevent runtime errors

#### After Making Changes

6. **Run Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   go test ./...        # Run all tests
   go fmt ./...         # Format code
   go vet ./...         # Static analysis
   go mod tidy          # Clean dependencies
   ```

7. **Update Documentation System**
   - **ALWAYS** update `docs/status.md` with:
     - Current progress and completed items
     - Any new issues encountered
     - Implementation decisions made
   - Update `docs/tasks/tasks.md` if tasks completed or status changed
   - Update `docs/technical.md` if new patterns or guidelines introduced
   - Add code comments for complex business logic
   - Update `docs/architecture.mermaid` if system structure changed

## ü§ñ AI Development Principles

### The Three Pillars of Effective AI Development:
1. **Clear System Architecture**: AI needs to understand your system holistically
2. **Structured Task Management**: Break down work into digestible, testable chunks
3. **Explicit Development Rules**: Guide AI with clear patterns and conventions

### AI Code Quality Guidelines:
- **Prevent Hallucinations**: Use TDD to validate all AI-generated code
- **Avoid Complex Logic**: Break down business logic into smaller, testable units
- **State Management**: Avoid global state, use proper dependency injection
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Security Focus**: Always include security test cases and validations

### Working with AI Context Limits:
- Use `docs/status.md` as project memory for context restoration
- Reference documentation files to quickly restore AI understanding
- Structure tasks and documentation for easy AI parsing
- Update status frequently to maintain development continuity

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

This is a Go project using standard Go toolchain.

**IMPORTANT**: Before executing any Go commands, you MUST first run `source .envrc` to set up the correct Go environment variables (GOPROXY, GOSUMDB, GO111MODULE). This prevents environment-related issues.

### Command Examples:
- **Build**: `source .envrc && go build ./cmd/server`
- **Run**: `source .envrc && go run ./cmd/server/main.go`
- **Test**: `source .envrc && go test ./...`
- **Test with coverage**: `source .envrc && go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`
- **Format**: `source .envrc && go fmt ./...`
- **Lint**: `source .envrc && go vet ./...`
- **Dependencies**: `source .envrc && go mod tidy`
- **Add dependency**: `source .envrc && go get <package>`

## üö® Code Change Verification Protocol

**CRITICAL**: When making ANY code changes, you MUST follow this verification protocol to avoid breaking changes:

### 1. Pre-Change Analysis
Before making any code changes:
- **Identify Impact Scope**: List all files that might be affected by the change
- **Locate Related Tests**: Find all test files that test the code being changed
- **Check Dependencies**: Identify which other modules/packages depend on the changed code
- **Review Interfaces**: If changing interfaces, find all implementations and usages

### 2. Change Implementation Process
When implementing changes:
- **Make Incremental Changes**: Change one logical unit at a time
- **Update Related Code**: Immediately update all affected code (constructors, method calls, etc.)
- **Update Tests Simultaneously**: Update test cases as you change the production code
- **Maintain API Contracts**: If changing public interfaces, update all callers
- **Constants First**: Define constants before using values, avoid magic strings/numbers from day one

### 3. Mandatory Verification Steps
After EVERY code change, you MUST run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Verify compilation
source .envrc && go build ./...
# If compilation fails, fix ALL errors before proceeding

# 2. Run specific affected tests
source .envrc && go test ./path/to/changed/package/...
# If tests fail, fix ALL test failures before proceeding

# 3. Run full test suite
source .envrc && go test ./...
# If any tests fail, fix ALL failures or explicitly document why they're expected

# 4. Verify code quality
source .envrc && go vet ./...
source .envrc && go fmt ./...
```

### 4. Change Documentation Requirements
For every significant change:
- **Update Interface Documentation**: Update comments for changed interfaces
- **Update Error Messages**: If changing error handling, update all related error message tests
- **Update Status**: Record changes in `docs/status.md`
- **Update Architecture**: If changing structure, update `docs/architecture.mermaid`

### 5. Rollback Protocol
If verification fails and cannot be immediately fixed:
- **Document the Issue**: Record what broke and why in `docs/status.md`
- **Consider Rollback**: If the change is extensive, consider reverting to the last working state
- **Create Incremental Plan**: Break the change into smaller, testable increments

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Based on ERROR-001 experience:

1. **Interface Changes Without Implementation Updates**:
   - ‚ùå BAD: Change method signature but forget to update all implementations
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: Use IDE/tools to find all implementations and update them together

2. **Error System Changes Without Test Updates**:
   - ‚ùå BAD: Change error message format but leave old test assertions
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: Update error tests immediately when changing error behavior

3. **Incomplete Compilation Verification**:
   - ‚ùå BAD: Only test changed package, miss dependencies
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: Always run `go build ./...` to verify entire codebase

4. **Partial Test Updates**:
   - ‚ùå BAD: Update some tests but leave others failing
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: Update ALL affected tests or document expected failures

5. **Hardcoded Constants vs Defined Constants**:
   - ‚ùå BAD: Use magic strings/numbers in code (`"VALIDATION_ERROR"`, `500`, etc.)
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: Define constants first, then use them (`errors.CodeValidationError`, `http.StatusInternalServerError`)
   - **Principle**: Always prefer constants from day one to avoid expensive refactoring later

### üìã Change Checklist Template

For every significant code change, use this checklist:

- [ ] Identified all files that will be affected
- [ ] Located and reviewed all related test files
- [ ] Made changes incrementally with immediate verification
- [ ] Updated all affected implementations/callers
- [ ] Updated all related test cases
- [ ] Verified: No hardcoded constants used (prefer defined constants)
- [ ] Verified: `go build ./...` passes
- [ ] Verified: `go test ./...` passes (or documented expected failures)
- [ ] Verified: `go vet ./...` passes
- [ ] Updated documentation and comments
- [ ] Updated `docs/status.md` with change summary

## üéØ Current Focus and Task Management

**Always check `docs/tasks/tasks.md` for the latest priorities and active tasks.**

### Task-Driven Development Approach:
1. **Reference Active Tasks**: Check `docs/tasks/tasks.md` for current sprint tasks
2. **Update Progress**: Mark tasks as in-progress in `docs/status.md`
3. **Follow Requirements**: Implement according to acceptance criteria
4. **Track Completion**: Update both task and status files upon completion

### Context-Aware Development:
- Use file references to maintain context across sessions
- Document implementation decisions for future reference
- Keep status tracking updated for AI context restoration

## üìÅ Key Directory Structure

- `cmd/server/` - Application entry point
- `internal/domain/` - Domain layer (entities, aggregates, domain services)
- `internal/application/` - Application layer (use cases, application services)
- `internal/infrastructure/` - Infrastructure layer (repositories, external services)
- `internal/interfaces/` - Interface layer (HTTP handlers, DTOs)
- `pkg/` - Shared packages
- `docs/` - Project documentation

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance and AI Context

### Documentation Structure for AI Understanding:
- **`docs/status.md`**: Project progress tracking and current state (critical for context restoration)
- **`docs/tasks/tasks.md`**: Task breakdown and requirements (source of truth for current work)
- **`docs/technical.md`**: Implementation guidelines and patterns (technical reference)
- **`docs/architecture.mermaid`**: System architecture visualization (architectural constraints)

### Maintenance Guidelines:
- Keep all documentation in `docs/` directory current and synchronized
- Update task status in real-time as work progresses
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Maintain code examples and patterns in technical docs
- Reference file paths with line numbers when discussing code
- Use documentation files as context anchors for AI sessions

### AI Context Management:
- Reference documentation files to restore context after limits
- Use status tracking to maintain development continuity
- Update documentation proactively to support future AI sessions
- Structure information for easy AI parsing and understanding
