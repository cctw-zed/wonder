## 🐛 Known Issues

### To Be Fixed
- **Legacy Test Updates Required**: Domain, application, and interface layer tests need updates to match new error handling system
  - Error message format changes: Old tests expect previous error message formats
  - Expected behavior: Tests will need updates when switching to new standardized error messages
  - Status: Non-blocking - compilation works, but behavioral tests need alignment
  - Impact: Affects test coverage reporting but not production functionality

### Technical Debt
- **Documentation Sync**: Need to synchronize documentation after code changes
- **Dependency Management**: Need to clarify external dependencies and version management strategy
- **Server Entry Point**: Missing main.go to actually start HTTP server

### Process Improvements Implemented
- **✅ Code Change Verification Protocol**: Added comprehensive verification steps to prevent incomplete changes
- **✅ Change Impact Analysis**: Established process for identifying affected code before making changes
- **✅ Incremental Change Guidelines**: Documented best practices for safe code modifications

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: 93.4% (Target: 80%) ✅
- **API Response Time**: Not tested (Target: <100ms)
- **Error Rate**: Not tracked
- **Deployment Frequency**: Not established
- **Test Execution Time**: ~8 seconds for full test suite

### Business Metrics
- **User Registration**: Interface implemented, not deployed
- **ID Generation**: Snowflake algorithm implemented
- **System Availability**: Local development environment

---

## 🔄 Architecture Evolution Plan

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- Improve Repository layer implementation
- Establish basic configuration management
- Implement unified error handling

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
- Improve business domain models
- Integrate database and cache
- Establish monitoring and logging system

### Long Term (3-6 months)
- Microservice architecture evolution
- Performance optimization and scalability
- Complete DevOps process

---

## 🔍 Risks and Dependencies

### Current Risks
- **Technology Selection**: Database selection pending (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment Environment**: Deployment plan and environment configuration not determined

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: Need to choose appropriate relational database
- **Cache**: Consider Redis as caching solution
- **Message Queue**: May need message queue support in the future

### Mitigation Measures
- Establish technology research and selection documentation
- Create MVP version for rapid validation
- Maintain architecture flexibility and scalability
