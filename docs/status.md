## 📋 Todo Items

### High Priority
- [x] **Infrastructure Enhancement**: Implement Repository layer database operations ✅ **Completed**
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Unified error handling and response format
- [x] **Configuration Management**: Environment configuration and config file management ✅ **Completed**

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Business Logic**: Improve user business logic implementation
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Request parameter validation and business rule validation
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Unit tests and integration tests

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**: Structured logging and performance monitoring

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### To Be Fixed
- **Repository Layer Not Implemented**: Currently only interface definitions exist, missing concrete implementations
- **Missing Configuration Management**: No configuration files and environment variable management
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Lack of unified error handling mechanism

### Technical Debt
- **Documentation Sync**: Need to synchronize documentation after code changes
- **Dependency Management**: Need to clarify external dependencies and version management strategy
- **Server Entry Point**: Missing main.go to actually start HTTP server

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: 93.4% (Target: 80%) ✅
- **API Response Time**: Not tested (Target: <100ms)
- **Error Rate**: Not tracked
- **Deployment Frequency**: Not established
- **Test Execution Time**: ~8 seconds for full test suite

### Business Metrics
- **User Registration**: Interface implemented, not deployed
- **ID Generation**: Snowflake algorithm implemented
- **System Availability**: Local development environment

---

## 🔄 Architecture Evolution Plan

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- Improve Repository layer implementation
- Establish basic configuration management
- Implement unified error handling

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
- Improve business domain models
- Integrate database and cache
- Establish monitoring and logging system

### Long Term (3-6 months)
- Microservice architecture evolution
- Performance optimization and scalability
- Complete DevOps process

---

## 🔍 Risks and Dependencies

### Current Risks
- **Technology Selection**: Database selection pending (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment Environment**: Deployment plan and environment configuration not determined

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: Need to choose appropriate relational database
- **Cache**: Consider Redis as caching solution
- **Message Queue**: May need message queue support in the future

### Mitigation Measures
- Establish technology research and selection documentation
- Create MVP version for rapid validation
- Maintain architecture flexibility and scalability
