### TASK-301: Integrate Monitoring Platform
Status: **🚧 In Progress**
Priority: **High**
Dependencies: Database availability
DDD Layer: **Infrastructure Layer**

#### 📋 Requirements Description
Implement end-to-end monitoring for the Wonder service by wiring metrics and traces into the chosen observability stack (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana or an APM provider). Ensure containerized deployments emit metrics and logs in the required format and that alert hooks are documented.

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
1. Service exports health and performance metrics consumable by the monitoring platform.
2. Dashboards or alerts are configured/documented for critical service indicators.
3. Automated checks or scripts verify monitoring integration in local Docker environment.

#### 🔧 Technical Notes
- Reuse existing logging and configuration modules for telemetry setup.
- Follow DDD boundaries: keep monitoring wiring in infrastructure layer adapters.
- Ensure Docker Compose stack includes any monitoring agents or configuration.
- Add integration tests or smoke checks for telemetry endpoints when feasible.

#### 📊 Estimated Workload
- **Domain Modeling**: 0.5 days
- **Development Time**: 2 days
- **Testing Time**: 1 day
