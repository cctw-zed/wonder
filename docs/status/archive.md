## 📈 Business Metrics
- **User Registration**: Interface implemented, not deployed
- **ID Generation**: Snowflake algorithm implemented
- **System Availability**: Local development environment

## 🔄 Architecture Evolution Plan

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- Improve Repository layer implementation
- Establish basic configuration management
- Implement unified error handling

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
- Improve business domain models
- Integrate database and cache
- Establish monitoring and logging system

### Long Term (3-6 months)
- Microservice architecture evolution
- Performance optimization and scalability
- Complete DevOps process

## 🔍 Risks and Dependencies

### Current Risks
- **Technology Selection**: Database selection pending (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment Environment**: Deployment plan and environment configuration not determined

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: Need to choose appropriate relational database
- **Cache**: Consider Redis as caching solution
- **Message Queue**: May need message queue support in the future

### Mitigation Measures
- Establish technology research and selection documentation
- Create MVP version for rapid validation
- Maintain architecture flexibility and scalability

## 📝 Development Notes

### 2025-09-25
