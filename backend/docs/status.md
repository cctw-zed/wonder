# Wonder Project Status

> Last Updated: 2025-09-25

## üéØ Current Sprint Goals

**Sprint 2025-09**: Establish project foundation and development standards

### Priorities
- üî• **High Priority**: Improve infrastructure and core domain models
- ‚ö° **Medium Priority**: Implement basic CRUD operations and HTTP interfaces
- üìã **Low Priority**: Enhance documentation and test coverage

---

## üì¶ Completed Work Reference

All completed deliverables are archived in `docs/tasks/archive.md`. Longer-form historical notes now live in `docs/status/archive.md` so this status stays focused on active work.

---

## üöß Work in Progress

- Monitoring stack integration (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) scaffolded in Docker Compose; awaiting metric validation.
- Docker operations guide recorded and Makefile targets added.

---

## üìã Todo Items

> Track only active or upcoming work here. Move completed items to `docs/tasks/archive.md` immediately after closure.

- Integrate monitoring platform with Wonder service to expose metrics and connect dashboards/alerts.

## üêõ Known Issues

### To Be Fixed
- **Legacy Test Updates Required**: Domain, application, and interface layer tests need updates to match new error handling system
  - Error message format changes: Old tests expect previous error message formats
  - Expected behavior: Tests will need updates when switching to new standardized error messages
  - Status: Non-blocking - compilation works, but behavioral tests need alignment
  - Impact: Affects test coverage reporting but not production functionality

### Technical Debt
- **Documentation Sync**: Need to synchronize documentation after code changes
- **Dependency Management**: Need to clarify external dependencies and version management strategy
- **Server Entry Point**: Missing main.go to actually start HTTP server

### Process Improvements Implemented
- **‚úÖ Code Change Verification Protocol**: Added comprehensive verification steps to prevent incomplete changes
- **‚úÖ Change Impact Analysis**: Established process for identifying affected code before making changes
- **‚úÖ Incremental Change Guidelines**: Documented best practices for safe code modifications
